                <p>
                  nu_runs is a student led college fitness initiative that was
                  launched by the very members of this group in 2019. Its
                  founders include computer science undergraduate students who
                  are fitness enthusiasts. Initially started off as a running
                  group, now also extends to strength training and flexibility
                  exercises. Building a larger student community, we believe
                  will increase the reach of our club and also enable us to
                  perform our duties better. As the youth of the worldâ€™s
                  population we take it upon ourselves to carry on uninterrupted
                  in our goal towards health for all.
